# Tetromino
Tetromino is a 3D puzzle platforming game that I am creating as my 
final project for my CPI 211 course at Arizona State University. The
objective of the game is to interact with a variety of devices and
gameplay mechanics to reach the end of each level. The game is a work
in progress at the moment.

This is the WebGL version of the game. For some
reason the Titlescreen is cut off so be sure to put
the game in fullscreen mode until I fix it.
